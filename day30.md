## Notes

Tips:

Take the practice exam for both halves of the test - this will help you see what you need to study.

* The first half of the exam is much more command heavy than the second half.
  * Learning file types, permissions, and in general where certain files are stored is much more important in a real job than it is on the exam.
  * Commands for job management are extremely important. The exam does not emphasize this enough.

* For the second half of the exam network theory is a must. Flashcards are useful here. You either know it or you don't.

* There are flash card decks pre-made and publicly available through Anki. Beware that publicly available decks may have mistakes.
