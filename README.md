# 30DaysOfLinux
I am using this repository to document my journey studying for the LPIC-1 exam. I began on January 25th, and will continue to February 25th. I will study for one hour a day and update my progress here.

Inspired by Michael Cade's 90DaysOfDevOps [repository](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps).
